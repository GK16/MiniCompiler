# P5: Type Checker

Guikai Huang (ghuang49@wisc.edu)

For this assignment I write a type checker for Gibberish programs represented as abstract-syntax trees. The main task is to write **_`typeCheck()`_** methods for the nodes of the **_ast.java_**.
In addition I also:

1. Modified P5.java.
2. Wrote two test inputs: typeErrors.gibberish and test.gibberish to test the new code.

## Build and Test

```
# build
make
# test
make test
```
